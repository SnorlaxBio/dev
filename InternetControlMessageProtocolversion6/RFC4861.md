Neighbor Discovery for Internet Protocol version 6<sup>IPv6</sup>
=================================================================

### Abstract

This document specifies the Neighbor Discovery protocol for Internet Protocol version 6<sup>IPv6</sup>. Internet Protocol version 6<sup>IPv6</sup> nodes on the same link use Neighbor Discovery to discover each other's presence, to determine each other's link layer addresses, to find routers, and to maintain reachability information about the paths to active neighbors.

## 1. Introduction

This specification defines the Neighbor Discovery<sup>ND</sup> protocol for Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup>. Nodes (hosts and routers) use Neighbor Discovery to determine the link layer addresses for neighbors known to reside on attached links and to quickly purge cached values that become invalid. Hosts also use Neighbor Discovery to find neighboring routers that are willing to forward packets on their behalf. Finally, nodes use the protocol to actively keep track of which neighbors are reachable and which are not, and to detect changed link layer addresses. When a router or the path to a router fails, a host actively searches for functioning alternates.

Unless specified otherwise (in a document that covers operating Internet Protocol<sup>IP</sup> over a particular link type) this document applies to all link types. However, because Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup> uses link layer multicast for some of its services, it is possible that on some link types (e.g., Non-Broadcast Multi Access <sup>NBMA</sup> links), alternative protocols or mechanisms to implement those services will be specified (in the appropriate document covering the operation of Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> over a particular link type). The services described in this document that are not directly dependent on multicast, such as Redirects, Next-hop determination, Neighbor Unreachability Detection, etc., are expected to be provided as specified in this document. The details of how one uses Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup> on Non-Broadcast Multi Access <sup>NBMA</sup> links are addressed in [IPv6 over Non-Broadcast Multiple Access (NBMA) networks](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2491). In addition, [Recommendations for IPv6 in Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Standards](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3314) and [Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) for Some Second and Third Generation Cellular Hosts](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3316) discuss the use of this protocol over some cellular links, which are examples of Non-Broadcast Multi Access <sup>NBMA</sup> links.

## 2. Terminology

### 2.1. General

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| IP    | Internet Protocol version 6. The terms Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> and Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> are used only in contexts where necessary to avoid ambiguity. |
| ICMP  | Internet Control Message Protocol for the Internet Protocol version 6. The terms Internet Control Message Protocol verison 4 <sup>ICMPv4</sup> and Internet Control Message Protocol verison 6 <sup>ICMPv6</sup> are used only in contexts where necessary to avoid ambiguity. |
| Node  | A device that implements Internet Protocol. |
| Router | A node that forwards Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> packets not explicitly addressed to itself. |
| Host  | Any node that is not a router. |
| Upper layer | A protocol layer immediately above Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup>. Examples are transport protocols such as Transmission Control Protocol <sup>TCP</sup> and User Datagram Protocol <sup>UDP</sup>, control protocols such as Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup>, routing protocols such as Open Shortest Path First <sup>OSPF</sup>, and Internet layer (or lower layer) protocols being "tunneled" over (i.e., encapsulated in) Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> such ad Internetwork Packet Exchange <sup>IPX</sup>, AppleTalk, or Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> itself. |
| link | a communcation facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup>. Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged), PPP links, X.25, Frame Relay, or ATM networks as well as Internet layer (or higher layer) "tunnels", such as tunnels over Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> or Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> itself. |
| interface | A node's attachment to a link. |
| neighbors | nodes attached to the same link. |
| address | an Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer identifier for an interface or a set of interfaces. |
| anycast address | An identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging to different nodes). A packet sent to an anycast address if delivered to one of the interfaces identified by that address (the "nearest" one, according to the routing protocol's measure of distance). See [IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291).<br /><br />Note that an anycast address is syntactically indistinguishable from a unicast address. Thus, nodes sending packets to anycast addresses don't generally know that an anycast address is being used. Throughout the rest of this document, references to unicast addresses also apply to anycast addresses in those cases where the node is unaware that a unicast address is actually an anycast address. |
| prefix | a bit string that consists of some number of initial bits of an address. |
| link layer address | a link layer identifier for an interface. Examples include IEEE 802 addresses for Ethernet links. |
| on link | an address that is assigned to an interface on a specified link. A node considers an address to be on link if:<br /><br />- it is covered by one of the link's prefixes (e.g., as indicated by the on link flag in the Prefix Information option)<br /><br />- a neighboring router specifies the address as the target of a Redirect message<br /><br />- a Neighbor Advertisement message is received for the target address<br /><br />- any Neighbor Discovery message is received from the address. |
| off link | the opposite of "on link"; an address that is not assigned to any interfaces on the specified link. |
| longest prefix match | the process of determining which prefix (if any) i a set of prefixes covers a target address. A target address is covered by a prefix if all of the bits in the prefix match the left-most bits of the target address. When multiple prefixes cover an address, the longest prefix is the one that matches. |
| reachability | whether or not the one-way "forward" path to a neighbor is functioning properly. In particular, whether packets sent to a neighbor are reaching the Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer on the neighboring machine and are being processed properly by the receiving Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer. For neighboring routers, reachability means that packets sent by a node's Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer are delivered to the router's Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer, and the router is indeed forwarding packets (i.e., it is configured as a router, not a host). For hosts, reachability means that packets sent by a node's Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer are delivered to the neighbor host's Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer. |
| packet | an Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> header plus payload. |
| link MTU | the maximum transmission unit, i.e., maximum packet size in octets, that can be conveyed in one transmission unit over a link. |
| target | an address about which address resolution information is sought, or an address that is the new first hop when being redirected. |
| proxy | a node that responds to Neighbor Discovery query messages on behalf on another node. A router acting on behalf of a mobile node that has moved off link could potentailly act as a proxy for the mobile node. |
| ICMP destination unreachable indication | an error indication returned to the original sender of a packet that cannot be delivered for the reasons outlined in [Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMPv6) for the Internet Protocol Version 6 (IPv6) Specification](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4443). If the error occurs on a node other than the node originating the packet, an ICMP error message is generated. If the error occurs on the originating node, an implementation is not required to actually create and send an ICMP error packet to the source, as long as the upper layer sender is notified through an appropriate mechanism (e.g., return value from a procedure call). Note, however, that an implementation may find it convenient in some cases to return errors to the sender by taking the offending packet, generating an ICMP error message, and then delivering it (locally) through the generic error handling routines. |
| random delay | when sending out messages, it is sometimes necessary to delay a transmission for a random amount of time in order to prevent multiple nodes from transmitting at exactly the same time, or to prevent long-range periodic transmissions from synchronizing with each other sync. When a random component is required, a node calculates the actual delay in such a way that the computed delay forms a uniformly distributed random value that falls between the specified minimum and maximum delay times. The implementor must take care to ensure that thne granularity of the calculated random component and the resolution of the timer userd are both high enough to ensure that the probability of multiple nodes delaying the same amount of time is small. |
| random delay seed | if a pseudo random number generator is used in calculating a random delay component, the generator should be initialized with a unique seed prior to being used. Note that it is not sufficient to use the interface identifier alone as the seed, since interface identifiers will not always be unique. To reduce the probability that duplicate interface identifiers cause the same seed to be used, the seed should be calculated from a vaierty of input sources (e.g., machine components) that are likely to be different even on identical "boxes". For example, the seed could be formed by combining the CPU's serial number with an interface identifier. Additional information on randomness and random number generation can be found in [Randomness Requirements for Security](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4086). |

### 2.2. Link Types

Different link layers have different properties. The ones of concern to Neightbor Discovery are:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| multicast capable | a link that supports a native mechanism at the link layer for sending packets to all (i.e., broadcast) or a subset of all neighbors. |
| point-to-point | a link that connects exactly two interfaces. A point-to-point link is assumed to have multicast capability and a link local address. |
| Non-Broadcast Multi Access <sup>NBMA</sup> | a link to which more than two interfaces can attach, but that does not support a native form of multicast or broadcast (e.g., X.25, ATM, frame relay, etc.). Note that all link types (including NBMA) are expected to provide multicast service for applications that need it (e.g., using multicast servers). However, it is an issue for further study whether Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup> should use such facilities or an alternate mechanism that provides the equivalent multicast capability for Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup>. |
| shared media | a link that allows direct communication among a number of nodes, but attached nodes are configured in such a way that they do not have complete prefix information for all on link destinations. That is, at the Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> level, nodes on the same link may not know that they are neighbors; by default, they communicate through a router. Examples are large (switched) public data networks such as Switched Multimegabit Data Service <sup>SMDS</sup> and Broadband Integrated Service Digital Network <sup>B-ISND</sup>. Also known as "large clouds". See [Internet Architecture Extensions for Shared Media](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1620). |
| variable MTU | a link that does not have a well-defined MTU (e.g., IEEE 802.5 token rings). Many links (e.g., Ethernet) have a standard MTU defined by the link layer protocol or by the specific document describing how to run IP over the link layer. |
| asymmetric reachability | a link where non-reflexive and/or non-transitive reachability is part of normal operation. (Non-reflexive reachability means packets from A reach B, but packets from B don't reach A. Non-transitive reachability means packets from A reach B, and packets from B reach C, but packets from A don't reach C.) Many radio links exhibit these properties. |

### 2.3. Addresses

Neighbor Discovery makes use of a number of different addresses defined in [IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291), including:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| all-nodes multicast address | the link local scope address to reach all nodes, FF02::1. |
| all-routers multicast address | the link local scope address to reach all routers, FF02::2. |
| solicited-node multicast address | a link local scope multicast address that is computed as a function of the solicited target's address. The function is described in [IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291). The function is chosen so that Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> addresses that differ only in the most significant bits, e.g., due to multiple prefixes associated with different providers, will map to the same solicited-node address thereby reducing the number of multicast addresses a node must join at the link layer. |
| link-local address | a unicast address having link only scope that can be used to reach neighbors. All interfaces on routers must have a link local address. Also, [IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4862) requires that interfaces on hosts have a link local address. |
| unspecified address | a reserved address value that indicates the lack of an address (e.g., the address is unknown). It is never used as a destination address, but may be used as a source address if the sender does not (yet) know its own address (e.g., while verifying an address is used during stateless address autoconfiguration). The unspecified address has a value of 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:0. |

Note that this specification does not strictly comply with the consistency requirements in [Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3484) for the scopes of source and destination addresses. It is possible in some cases for hosts to use a source address of a large scope than the destination address in the IPv6 header.

## 3. Protocol Overview

This protocol solves a set of problems related to the interaction between nodes attached to the same link. It defines mechanisms for solving each of the following problems:

- Router Discovery

  How hosts locate routers that reside on an attached link.

- Prefix Discovery

  How hosts discover the set of address prefixes that define which destinations are on link for an attached link. (Notes use prefixes to distinguish destinations that reside on link from those only reachable through a router.)

- Parameter Discovery

  How a node learns link parameters (such as the Link Maximum Transmission Unit <sup>Link MTU</sup>) or Internet Parameters (such as the hop limit value) to place in outgoing packets.

- Address Autoconfiguration

  Introduces the mechanisms needed in order to allow nodes to configure an address for an interface in a stateless manner. Stateless address autoconfiguration is specified in [IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4862).

- Address resolution

  How nodes determine the link layer address of an on link destination (e.g., a neighbor) given only the destination's Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> address.

- Next-hop determination

  The algorithm for mapping an Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> destination address into the <sup>Internet Protocol</sup> address of the neighbor to which traffic for the destination should be sent. The next-hop can be a router or the destination itself.

- Neighbor Unreachability Detection

  How nodes determine that a neighbor is no longer reachable. For neighbors used as routers, alternate default routers can be tried. For both routers and hosts, address resolution can be performed again.

- Duplicate Address Detection

  How a node determines whether or not an address it wishes use is already in use by another node.

- Redirect

  How a router informs a host of a better first-hop node to reach a particular destination.

Neighbor Discovery defines five different Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> packet types: A pair of Router Solicitation and Router Advertisement messages, a pair of Neighbor Solicitation and Neighbor Advertisements messages, and a Redirect message. The messages serve the following purpose:

- Router Solicitation

  When an interface becomes enabled, hosts may send out Router Solicitations that request reouters to generate Router Advertisements immediately rather than at their next scheduled time.

- Router Advertisement

  Routers advertise their presence together with various link and Internet parameters either periodically, or in response to a Router Solicitation message. Router Advertisements contain prefixes that are used for determining whether another address shares the same link (on link determination) and/or address configuration, a suggested hop limit value, etc.

- Neighbor Solicitation

  Sent by a node to determine the link layer address of a neighbor, or to verify that a neighbor is still reachable via a cached link layer address. Neighbor Solicitations are also used for Duplicate Address Detection.

- Neighbor Advertisement

  A response to a Neighbor Solicitation message. A node may also send unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements to announce a link layer address change.

- Redirect

  Used by routers to inform hosts of a better first hop for a destination.

On multicast capable links, each router periodically multicasts a Router Advertisement packet announcing its availability. A host receives Router Advertisements from all routers, building a list of default routers. Routers generate Router Advertisements frequently enough that hosts will learn of their presence within a few minutes, but not frequently enough to rely on an absence of advertisements to detect router failure; a separate Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm provides failure detection.

Router Advertisement contain a list of prefix used for on link determination and/or autonomous address configuration; flags associated with the prefixes specify the intended uses of a particular prefix. Hosts use the advertised on link prefixes to build and maintain a list that is used in deciding when a packet's destination is on link or beyond a router. Note that a destination can be on link even though it is not covered by any advertised on link prefix. In such cases, a router can send a Redirect informing the sender that the destination is a neighbor.

Router Advertisements (and per-prefix flags) allow routers to inform hosts how to perform Address Autoconfiguration. For example, routers can specify whether hosts should use DHCPv6 and/or autonomous (stateless) address configuration.

Router Advertisement messages also contain Internet parameters such as the hop limit that hosts should use in outgoing packets and, optionally, link parameters such as the Link Maximum Transmission Unit <sup>Link MTU</sup>. This facilitates centralized administration of critical parameters that can be set on routers and automatically propagated to all attached hosts.

Notes accomplish address resolution by multicasting a Neighbor Solicitation that asks the target node to return its link layer address. Neighbor Solicitation messages are multicast to the solicited-node multicast address of the target address. The target returns its link layer address in a unicast Neighbor Advertisement message. A single request response response pair of packets is sufficient for both the initiator and the target to resolve each other's link layer addresses; the initiator includes its link layer address in the Neighbor Solicitation.

Neighbor Solicitation messages can also be used to determine if more than one node has been assigned the same unicast address. The use of Neighbor Solicitation messages for Duplicate Address Detection is specified in [IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4862).

Neighbor Unreachability Detection detects the failure of a neighbor or the failure of the forward path to the neighbor. Doing so requires positive confirmation that packets sent to a neighbor are actually reaching that neighbor and being processed properly by its Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer. Neighbor Unreachability Detection uses confirmation from two sources. When possible, upper layer protocols provide a positive confirmation that a connection is making "forward progress", that is, previously sent data is known to have been delivered correctly (e.g., new acknowledgments were received recently). When positive confirmation is not forthcoming through such "hints", a node sends unicast Neighbor Solicitation messages that solicit Neighbor Advertisements as reachability confirmation from the next hop. To reduce unnecessary network traffic, probe messages are only sent to neighbors to which the node is actively sending packets.

In addition to addressing the above general problems, Neighbor Discovery also handles the following situations:

- Link layer address change

  A node that knows its link layer address has changed can multicast a few (unsolicited) Neighbor Advertisement packets to all nodes quickly update cached link layer addresses that have become invalid. Note that the sending of unsolicited advertisements is a performance enhancement only (e.g., unreliable). The Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm ensures that all nodes will reliably discover the new address, though the delay may be somewhat longer.

- Inbound load balancing

  Nodes with replicated interfaces may want to load balance the reception of incoming packets across multiple network interfaces on the same link. Such nodes have multiple link layer addresses assigned to the same interface. For example, a single network driver could represent multiple network interface cards as a single logical interface having multiple link layer addresses. Neighbor Discovery allows a router to perform load balancing for traffic addressed to itself by allowing routers to omit the source link layer address from Router Advertisement packets, thereby forcing neighbors to use Neighbor Solicitation messages to learn link layer addresses that differ depending on, e.g., define a mechanism that allows hosts to Load-balance incoming packets. See [IPv6 Host-to-Router Load Sharing](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4311).

- Anycast addresses

  Anycast addresses identify one of a set of nodes providing an equivalent service, and multiple nodes on the same link may be configured to recognize the same anycast address. Neighbor Discovery handles anycasts by having nodes expect to receive multiple Neighbor Advertisements for the same target. All advertisements for anycast addresses are tagged as being non-Override advertisements. A non-Override advertisement is one that does not update or replace the information sent by another advertisement. These advertisements are discussed later in the context of Neighbor advertisement messages. This invokes specific rules to determine which of potentially multiple advertisements should be used.

- Proxy advertisements

  A node willing to accept packets on behalf of a target address that is unable to respond to Neighbor Solicitations can issue non-Override Neighbor Advertisements. Proxy advertisements are used by Mobile IPv6 Home Agents to defend mobile nodes' addresses when they move off link. However, it is not intended as a general mechanism to handle nodes that, e.g., do not implement this protocol.

### 3.1. Comparison with Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup>

The Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> Neighbor Discovery protocol corresponds to a combination of the Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> protocols Address Resolution Protocol [An Ethernet Address Resolution Protocol or Converting Network Protocol Addresses](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc826), Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Router Discovery [ICMP Router Discovery Messages](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1256), and Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Redirect. In Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> there is no generally agreed upon protocol or mechanism for Neighbor Unreachability Detection, although the Hosts Requirements document [Requirements for Internet Hosts -- Communication Layers](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1122) does specify some possible algorithms for Dead Gateway Detection (a subset of the problems Neighbor Unreachability Detection tackles).

The Neighbor Discovery protocol provides a multitude of improvements over the Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> set of protocols:

- Router Discovery is part of the base protocol set; there is no need for hosts to "snoop" the routing protocols.
- Router Advertisements carry link layer addresses; no additional packet exchange is needed to resolve the router's link layer address.
- Router Advertisements carry prefixes for a link; there is no need to have a separate mechanism to configure the "netmask".
- Router Advertisements enable Address Autoconfiguration.
- Routers can advertise an Maximum Transmission Unit <sup>MTU</sup> for hosts to use on the link, ensuring that all nodes use the same Maximum Transmission Unit <sup>MTU</sup> value on links lacking a well-defined Maximum Transmission Unit <sup>MTU</sup>.
- Address resolution multicasts are "spread" over 16 million (2^24) multicast addresses, greatly reducing address resolution related interrupts on nodes other than the target. Moreover, non-IPv6 machines should not be interrupted at all.
- Redirects contain the link layer address of the new first hop; separate address resolution is not needed upon receiving a redirect.
- Multiple prefixes can be associated with the same link. By default, hosts learn all on link prefixes from Router Advertisements. However, routers may be configured to omit some or all prefixes from Router Advertisements. In such cases hosts assume that destinations are off link and send traffic to routers. A router can then issue redirects as appropriate.
- Unlike Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup>, the recipient of an Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> redirect assumes that the new next-hop is on link. In Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup>, a host ignores redirects specifying a next-hop that is not on link according to the link's network mask. The Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> redirect mechanism is analogous to the XRedirect facility specified in [Internet Architecture Extensions for Shared Media](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1620). It is expected to be useful on non-broadcast and shared media links in which it is undesirable or not possible for nodes to know all prefixes for on-link destinations.
- Neighbor Unreachability Detection is part of the base, which significantly improves the robustness of packet delivery in the presence of failing routers, partially failing or partitioned links, or nodes that change their link layer addresses. For instance, mobile nodes can move off link without losing any connectivity due to stale ARP caches.

Unlike ARP, Neighbor Discovery detects half-link failures (using Neighbor Unreachability Detection) and avoids sending traffic to neighbors with which two-way connectivity is absent.

Unlike in Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> Router Discovery, the Router Advertisement messages do not contain a preference field. The preference field isnot needed to handle routers of different "stability"; the Neighbor Unreachability Detection will detect dead routers and switch to a working one.

The use of link local addresses to uniquely identify routers (for Router Advertisement and Redirect messages) makes it possible for hosts to maintain the router associations in the event of the site renumering to use new global prefixes.

By setting the Hop Limit to 255, Neighbor Discovery is immune to off lnik senders that accidentally or intentionally send Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup> messages. In Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup>, off link senders can send both Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Redirects and Router Advertisement messages.

Placing address resolution at the Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> layer makes the protocol more media-independent than ARP and makes it possible to use generic IP-layer authentication and security mechanisms as appropriate.

### 3.2. Supported Link Types

Neighbor Discovery supports links with different properties. In the presence of certain properties, only a subset of the Neighbor Discovery <sup>ND</sup> protocol mechanisms are fully specified in this document:

- point-to-point

  Neighbor Discovery handles such links just like multicast links. (Multicast can be trivially provided on point-to-point links, and interfaces can be assigned link-local addresses.)

- multicast

  Neighbor Discovery operates over multicast capable links.

- Non-Broadcast multiple Access <sup>MBMA</sup>

  Redirect, Neighbor Unreachability Detection and next-hop determination should be implemented as described in this document. Address resolution, and the mechanism for delivering Router Solicitations and Advertisements on Non-Broadcast multiple Access <sup>MBMA</sup> links are not specified in this document. Note that if hosts support manual configuration of a list of default routers, hosts can dynamically acquire the link layer addresses for their neighbors from Redirect messages.

- shared media

  The Redirect message is modeled after the XRedirect message in [Internet Architecture Extensions for Shared Media](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1620) in order to simplify use of the protocol on shared medai links.

  This specification does not address shared media issues that only relate to routers, such as:

  - How routers exchange reachability information on a shared media link
  - How a router determines the link-layer address of a host, which it needs to send redirect messages to the host.
  - How a router determines that it is the first hop router for a received packet.

  The protocol is extensible (through the definition of new options) so that other solutions might be possible in the future.

- Variable MTU

  Neighbor Discovery allows routers to specify an MTU for the link, which all nodes then use. All nodes on a link must use the same MTU (or Maximum Received Unit) in order for multicast to work properly. Otherwise, when multicasting, a sender, which can not know which nodes will receive the packet, could not determine a minimum packet size that all receivers can process (or Maximum Receive Unit).

- Asymmetric Reachability

  Neighbor Discovery detects the absence of symmetric reachability; a node avoids paths to a neighbor with which it does not have symmetric connectivity.

  The Neighbor Unreachability Detection will typically identify half-links and the node will refrain from using them.

  The protocol can presumably be extended in the future to find viable paths in environments that lack reflexive and transitive connectivity.

### 3.3. Securing Neighbor Discovery Messages

Neighbor Discovery messages are needed for various functions. Several functions are designed to allow hosts to ascertain the ownership of an address or the mapping between link layer and Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> layer addresses. Vulnerabilities related to Neighbor Discovery are discussed in Section 11.1. A general solution for securing Neighbor Discovery is outside the scope of this specification and is discussed in [SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3971). However, Section 11.2 explains how and under which constraints IPsec Authentication Header <sup>AH</sup> or Encapsulating Security Payload <sup>ESP</sup> can be used to secure Neighbor Discovery.

## 4. Message Formats

This function introduces message formats for all messages used in this specification.

### 4.1. Router Solicitation Message Format

Hosts send Router Solicitations in order to prompt routers to generate Router Advertisements quickly.

![Router Solicitation Message](./images/rfc4861/RouterSolicitationMessage.png)

Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> Fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Source Address | An Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> address assigned to the sending interface, or the unspecified address if no address is assigned to the sending interface. |
| Destination Address | Typically the all routers multicast address. |
| Hop Limit | 255 |

Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Field:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Type  | 133 |
| Code  | 0 |
| Checksum | The Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> checksum |
| Reserved | This field is unused. It must be initialized to zero by the sender and must be ignored by the receiver. |

Valid Options:

- Source link layer address

  The link layer address of the sender, if known. Must not be included if the Source Address is the unspecified address. Otherwise, it should be included on link layers that have addresses.

Future versions of this protocol may define new option types. Receivers must silently ignore any options they do not recognize and continue processing the message.

### 4.2. Router Advertisement Message Format

Routers send out Router Advertisement messages periodically, or in response to Router Solicitations.

![Router Advertisement Message](./images/rfc4861/RouterAdvertisementMessage.png)

Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> Fields:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Source Address | Must be the link local address assigned to the interface from which this message is sent. |
| Destination Address | Typically the Source Address of invoking Router Solicitation or the all nodes multicast address. |
| Hop Limit | 255 |

Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Field:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Type  | 134 |
| Code | 0 |
| Checksum | The Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> checksum. |
| Cur Hop Limit | 8 bit unsigned integer. The default value that should be placed i the Hop Count field of the Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> header for outgoing Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> packets. A value of zero means unspecified (by this router). |
| M | 1 bit "Managed address configuration" flag. When, set it indicates that addresses are available via [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol <sup>DHCPv6</sup>](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3315).<br /><br />If the M flag is set, the O flag is redundant and can be ignored because Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 <sup>DHCPv6</sup> will return all available configuration information. |
| O | 1 bit "Other configuration" flag. When set, it indicates that other configuration information is available via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 <sup>DHCPv6</sup>. Examples of such information are DNS-related information or information on other servers within the network. |
| Router Lifetime | 16 bit unsigned integer. The lifetime associated with the default router in units of seconds. The field can contain values up to 65535 and receivers should handle any value, while the sending rules in Section 6 limit the lifetime to 9000 seconds. A Lifetime of 0 indicates that the router is not a default router and should not appear on the default router list. The Router Lifetime applies only to the router's usefulness as a default router; it does not apply to information contained in other message fields or options. Options that need time limits for their information include their own lifetime fields. |
| Reachable Time | 32 bit unsigned integer. The time, in milliseconds, that a node assumes a neighbor is reachable after having received a reachability confirmation. Used by the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (see Section 7.3). A value of zero means unspecified (by this router). |
| Retrans Timer | 32 bit unsigned integer. The time, in milliseconds, between retransmitted Neighbor Solicitation messages. Used by address resolution and the Neighbor Unreachability Detection algorithm (see Sections 7.2 and 7.3). A value of zero means unspecified (by this router). |

Note: If neither M nor O flags are set, this indicates that no information is available via Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6 <sup>DHCPv6</sup>.

Possible options:

- Source link layer address

  The link layer address of the interface from which the Router Advertisement is sent. Only used on link layers that have addresses. A router may omit this option in order to enable inbound load sharing across multiple link layer addresses.

- MTU

  Should be sent on links that have a variable MTU (as specified in the document that describes how to run IP over the particular link type). May be sent on other links.

- Prefix Information

  These Options specify the prefixes that are on link and/or are used for stateless address autoconfiguration. A router should include all its on link prefixes (except the link local prefix) so that multihomed hosts have complete prefix information about on link destinations for the links to which they attach. If complete information is lacking, a host with multiple interfaces may not be able to choose the correct outgoing interface when sending traffic to its neighbors.

Future versions of this protocol may define new option types. Receivers MUST silently ignore any options they do not recognize and continue processing the message.

### 4.3. Neighbor Solicitation Message Format

Nodes send Neighbor Solicitations to request the link layer address of a target node while also providing their own link layer address to the target. Neighbor Solicitations are multicast when the node needs to resolve an address and unicast when the node seeks to verify the reachability of a neighbor.

Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> Field:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Source Address | Either an address assigned to the interface fro which this message is sent or (if Duplicate Address Detection is in progress) the unspecified address. |
| Destination Address | Either the solicited node multicast address corresponding to the target address, or the target address. |
| Hop Limit | 255 |

Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Field:

| Field | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| Type | 135 |
| Code | 0 |
| Checksum | The Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> checksum. |
| Target Address | The Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> address of the target of the solicitation. It must not be a multicast address. |

Possible options:

- Source link layer address

  The link layer address for the sender. Must not be included when the source Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> address is the unspecified address. Otherwise, on link layers that have addresses this option must be included in multicast solicitations and should be included in unicast solicitations.

Future versions of this protocol may define new option types. Receivers MUST silently ignore any options they do not recognize and continue processing the message.

### 4.4. Neighbor Advertisement Message Format

A node sends Neighbor Advertisements in response to Neighbor Solicitations and sends unsolicited Neighbor Advertisements in order to (unreliably) propagate new information quickly.

![Neighbor Advertisement Message](./images/rfc4861/NeighborAdvertisementMessage.png)

Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> Fields:

- Source Address

  An address assigned to the interface from which the advertisement is sent

- Destination Address

  For solicited advertisements, the Source Address of an invoking Neighbor Solicitation or, if the solicitation's Source Address is the unspecified address, the all nodes multicast address.

  For unsolicited advertisement typically tha all nodes multicast address.

- Hop Limit

  255

Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> Field:

- Type

  136

- Code

  0

- Checksum

  The Internet Control Message Protocol <sup>ICMP</sup> checksum.

- R

  Routing flag. When set, the R-bit indicates that the sender is a router. The R-bit is used by Neighbor Unreachability Detection to detect a router that changes to a host.

- S

  Solicited flag. When set, the S-bit indicates that the advertisement was sent in response to a Neighbor Solicitation from the Destination address. The S-bit is used as a reachability confirmation for Neighbor Unreachability Detection. It must not be set in multicast advertisements or in unsolicited unicast advertisements.

- O

  Override flag. When set, the O-bit indicates that the advertisement should override an existing cache entry and update the cached link layer address. When it is not set the advertisement will not update a cached link layer address though it will update an existing Neighbor Cache entry for which no link layer address is known. It should not be set in solicited advertisements for anycast addresses and in solicited proxy advertisements. It should be set in other solicited advertisements and in unsolicited advertisements.

- Target Address

  For solicited advertisements, the Target Address field in the Neighbor Solicitation message that prompted this advertisement. For an unsolicited advertisement, the address whose link layer address has changed. The Target Address must not be a multicast address.

Possible options:

- Target link layer address

  The link layer address for the target, i.e., the sender of the advertisement. This option must be included on link layers that have addresses when responding to multicast solicitations. When responding to a unicast Neighbor Solicitation this option should be included.

  The option must be included for multicast solicitations in order to avoid infinite Neighbor Solicitation "recursion" when the peer node does not have a cache entry to return a Neighbor Advertisement message. When responding to unicast solicitations, the option can be omitted since the sender of the solicitation has the correct link layer address; otherwise, it would not be able to send the unicast solicitation in the first place. However, including solicitation in the first place. However, including the link layer address in this case adds little overhead and eliminates a potential race condition where the sender deletes the cached link layer address prior to receiving a response to a previous solicitation.
