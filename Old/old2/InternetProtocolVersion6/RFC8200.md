## 1. Introduction

Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> is a new version of Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup>, designed as the successor to Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> [RFC791](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791). The changes from Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> to Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> fall primarily into the following categories:

- Expanded Addressing Capabilities

    Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> increases the Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> address size from 32 bits to 128 bits, to support more levels of addressing hierarchy, a much greater number of addressable nodes, and simpler autoconfiguration on addresses. The scalability of multicase routing is improved by adding a "scope" field to multicast addresses. And a new type of address called an "anycast address" is defined; it is used to send a packet to any one of a group of nodes.

- Header Format Simplication

    Sime Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> header fields have been dropped or made optional, to reduce the common-case processing cost of packet handling and to limit the bandwidth cost of the Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> header.

- Improved Support for Extensions and Options

    Changes in the way Internet Protocol <sup>IP</sup> header options are encoded allows for more efficient forwarding, less stringent limits on the length of options, and greater flexibility for introducing new options in the future.

- Flow Labeling Capability

    A new capability is added to enable the labeling of sequences of packets that the sender requests to be treated in the network as a single flow.

- Authentication and Privacy Capabilities

    Extensions to support authentication, data integrity, and (optional) data confidentiality are specifeid for Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup>.

This document specifies the basic Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> header and the initially defined Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> extension headers and options. It also discusses packet size issues, the semantics of flow labels and traffic classes, and the effects of Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> on upper-layer protocols. The format and semantics of Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> addresses are specified separately in [RFC4291](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291). The Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> version of ICMP, which add Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> implementations are required to include, ins specified in [RFC4443](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4443).

The data transmission order for Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> is the same for Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> as defined Appendix B of [RFC791](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc791).

Note: As this document obsoletes [RFC2460](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2460), any document referenced in this document that includes pointers to [RFC2460](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2460) should be interpreted as referencing this document.

## 2. Terminology

node: a device that implements Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup>

router: a node that forwards Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> packets not explicitly addressed to itself.

host: any node that is not a router.

upper layer: a protocol layer immediately above Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup>. Examples are transport protocols such as TCP and UDP, control protocols such as ICMP, routing protocols such as OSPF, and internet-layer or lower-layer protocols being "tunneled" over (i.e., encapsulated in) Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> such as Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), AppleTalk, or Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> itself.

link: a communication facility or medium over which nodes can communicate at the link layer, i.e., the layer immediately below Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup>. Examples are Ethernets (simple or bridged); PPP links; X.25, Frame Relay, or ATM networks; and internet-layer or higher-layer "tunnels", such as tunnels over Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> or Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> itself.

neighbors: node attached to the same link

interface: a node's attachment to a link

address: an Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> layer identifier for an interface or a set of interfaces.

packet: an Internet Protocol verison 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> header plus payload.

link MTU: the maximum transmission unit, i.e., maximum packet size in octets, that can be conveyed over a link.

path MTU: the minimu link MTU of all the links in a path between a source node and a destination node.

Node: it is possible for a device with multiple interfaces to be configured to forward non-self-destined packets arriving from some set (fewer than all) of its interfaces and to discard non-self-destined packets arriving from its other interfaces. Such a device must obey the protocol requirements for routers when receiving packets from, and interacting with neighbors over, the former (forwarding) interfaces. It must obey the protocol requirements for hosts when receiving packets from, and interacting with neighbors over, the latter (non-forwarding) interfaces.

## 3. Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> Header Format

![Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> Header Format](./images/rfc8200/InternetProtocolVersion6HeaderFormat.png)

Version: 4 bit Internet Protocol version number = 6

Traffic Class: 8 bit Traffic Class field.

Flow Label: 20 bit flow label.

Payload Length: 16 bit unsigned integer. Length of the Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> payload, i.e., the rest of the packet following this Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> header, in octets. (Note that any extension headers present are considered part of the payload i.e., included in the length count.)

Next Header: 8 bit selector. Identifies the type of header immediately following the Internet Protocol version 6 <sup>IPv6</sup> header. Uses the same values as the Internet Protocol version 4 <sup>IPv4</sup> protocol field [Protocol Numbers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml).

Hop Limit: 8 bit unsigned integer. Decremented by 1 by each node that forwards the packet. When forwarding, the packet is discarded if Hop Limit was zero when received or is determented to zero. A node that is the destination of a packet should not discard a packet with Hop Limit equal to zero; it should process the packet normally.

Source Address: 128 bit address of the originator of the packet. [RFC4291](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291)

Destination Address: 128 bit address of the intended recipient of the packet (possibly not the ultimate recipient, if the Routing header is present). [RFC4291](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4291) and [RFC8200 Section 4.4](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8200#section-4.4)
